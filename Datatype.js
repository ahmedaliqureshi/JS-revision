//there are mainly  brodaly 2 types of datatypes, 
// 1) premitive 
// 2) non premitive 

//note:- most of the datatypes are declared with only with the variable declaration of let 

//1) premitive data type are those kind of datatype that only stores only one kind of data 

//1.1) let numb = some number (numb being any number,ex:- 45323 )
//1.2) let string = some string (string being any sentence or string, ex;- hello, hi, this is)
//1.3) let boolean = either true or false 
//1.4) let bigint = any number of greater then 6 ot 8 digits greater (ex:-23343455689802)

//2) non promitive data type are those kind of datatype that can stroe multiple kinds of data

//2.1) array:- they can hold string, number, boolean, or similar datatype, and declared with 
//closed parenthesis []
//ex;- ["hi",2,true]; 

//2.2) object: they too can hold multiply kinds of datatypes, but they have one thing to store the value 
//in them and that is known as key value
